# This file contains information about the grid hierarchy.
# Comments are allowed (start the line with "#" or "!").
# The idea is to make a list with a hierarchy of MPAS grid meshes,
#   with the highest resolution mesh listed first, and the 
#   meshes coarsening with each successive line.
# There are three columns of data per line:
#    1) Path to a file with MPAS grid information. Should work with "grid.nc" files, 
#       but "static.nc" or "init.nc" files might be safer.
#       ENCLOSE WITHIN QUOTES IF USING "/" CHARACTER IN THE PATH
#    2) Nominal horizontal cell spacing of the mesh (used for output file names and
#        for averaging when average_upscale_before_interp = .true. )
#    3) Weight (between 0 and 1) to give to the data providing LARGE SCALES 
#          for the given spatial scale during blending.
#
# You can download various grid meshes from the MPAS download page:
#   https://mpas-dev.github.io/atmosphere/atmosphere_meshes.html
#
# Filename of grid mesh |  Nominal grid spacing (km) of mesh | Weight of large-scale file for blending

# e.g., 3-km CONUS regional mesh, interpolated up a hierarchy of meshes
